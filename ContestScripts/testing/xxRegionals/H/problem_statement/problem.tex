It is time: the alignment of all eight planets (yes, eight---sorry, Pluto) is approaching. 
 The three stones of destiny must be put in place at the time of the alignment.

The first two stones have already been placed at integer coordinates. The third stone, named the \textit{holy stone}, must be placed at another point with integer coordinates to finish the triangle. The triangle may not be a straight line (it must have a positive area). The holy stone will activate only if it is at a point where the angle inside the triangle (formed at the holy stone) is as large as possible among all integer points.

Find a point where the holy stone would activate.


\section*{Input}

The input starts with an integer $T$~($1 \leq T \leq 10\,000$), which is the number of test cases.

The next $T$ lines describe the test cases. Each line contains four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$~($-10^9 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 10^9$), indicating that the first two stones are at locations $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. It is guaranteed that $(x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2)$.


\section*{Output}

For each test case, display the $x-$ and $y-$coordinate of a point with integer coordinates where the holy stone would activate. If there are multiple solutions, any will be accepted.
