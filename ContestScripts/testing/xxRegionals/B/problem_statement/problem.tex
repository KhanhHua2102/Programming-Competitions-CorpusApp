In Divisionals, we learned about Kyle and Leonard's pseudo-friendship. Today, they are out again at a restaurant where they are sharing a meal, which consists of $N$ food items.

Leonard noticed that Kyle bought him a really bad drink last time they were out and would like to return the favour. Every item of food in the meal has a tastiness value. Leonard will give some of the food items to Kyle and the rest to himself. Both people must receive at least one food item, and no food item can be eaten by both of them. The total tastiness value of a person's food items is the sum of all of their food items' tastiness values.

If the total tastiness value of Leonard's food items is $\ell$ and the total tastiness value of Kyle's food items is $k$, then Leonard's \textit{pettiness} value is $\ell - k$. Leonard will divide the food so that his pettiness value is maximized.

Given the tastiness values of all the food items, what is the largest pettiness value that Leonard can achieve?


\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains a single integer $N$~($2 \leq N \leq 300\,000$), which is the number of food items.

The next line contains $N$ integers $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N$~($-10^9 \leq t_i \leq 10^9$), which are the tastiness values of the food items.


\section*{Output}

Display the largest pettiness value that Leonard can achieve.
