\problemname{Lonely Wizard
}

Nathan is a thirty-year-old wizard who lives in a small town. He is very lonely
and awkward and wants to use his wizard powers to make everyone else lonely and
awkward.

He has a list of $N$ people in the town, and he knows which people are friends
with each other. Friendships are bidirectional: if $A$ is friends with $B$, then $B$ is friends
with $A$. He will use his wizard powers to partition the $N$ people into
two disjoint (possibly empty) sets. Everyone must be in exactly one of the two sets. People who are in different sets cannot communicate and will stop being friends as a result. People in the same set who are already friends will stay friends; there is nothing Nathan can do about this. Note that no new friendships will be created.

Nathan wants to cause the most division and strife possible, so he wants to
maximise the number of friendships that he destroys when partitioning the people
into two sets. Help Nathan find the maximum number of friendships that he can
destroy by partitioning the people into two sets.


\section*{Input}

The first line of the input contains two integers $N$~($1 \leq N \le
16$), which is the number of people in the town, and $F$~($0 \leq F \leq \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2}$), which is the number of friendships.

The following $F$ lines each contain two integers $A$, $B$~($1 \leq A < B \leq
N$), denoting a friendship between the persons $A$ and $B$. No friendship is duplicated in the input.


\section*{Output}

Display a single integer, which is the maximum number of friendships that
Nathan can destroy.
