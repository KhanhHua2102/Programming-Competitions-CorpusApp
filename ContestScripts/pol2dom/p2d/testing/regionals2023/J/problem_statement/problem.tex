\problemname{Jay's Son Ja\$on's Family Tree
}

Jay's son ja\$on has moved on from socks and is looking to start a family. But,
he has some very particular naming conventions. His son (and his sons' sons and so on)
will be named using the following rules:

The son's first name will be their father's first name concatenated with the letters ``SON''.
The son's middle name will be the concatenation of their father's first, middle, and last names.
The son's last name will be the same as their father's last name.

For example, Jay's son ja\$on's name is of the following form (but using uppercase letters):

\begin{itemize}
\item First: JAY'S
\item Middle: SON
\item Last: JA\$ON
\end{itemize}

Jay's son ja\$on's son (which we would call his first descendant) would have the following
first, middle, and last names (but using uppercase letters):

\begin{itemize}
\item First: JAY'SSON
\item Middle: JAY'SSONJA\$ON
\item Last: JA\$ON
\end{itemize}

And Jay's son ja\$on's grandson, which we call his second descendant, would
have the following first, middle, and last names (but using uppercase letters):

\begin{itemize}
\item First: JAY'SSONSON
\item Middle: JAY'SSONJAY'SSONJA\$ONJA\$ON
\item Last: JA\$ON
\end{itemize}

Jay's son ja\$on has convinced his friends to use this naming convention as well!
For example, his best friend BENNY FACTORS BENEFACTOR will give his future son
the following first, middle, and last names:

\begin{itemize}
\item First: BENNYSON
\item Middle: BENNYFACTORSBENEFACTOR
\item Last: BENEFACTOR
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, Jay's son ja\$on won't live forever so he can't make sure that
this naming convention is followed for all of his and his friends' descendants. But, he can come
back as a ghost and check a birth certificate. Since the birth certificate
will be very long he only has time to check one character of his or one of his friend's $K$th
descendant. If he finds the wrong letter in the birth certificate, he will haunt
this descendant for the rest of their life by stealing socks from the washing
machine.



Jay's son ja\$on needs your help to figure out the $C$th index character
(starting from 0) of his or one of his friend's $K$th descendant's full name, assuming the naming
convention has been followed correctly. The $C$th
index character in the full name of the $K$th descendant is the $C$th index
character of the concatenation of their first, middle, and last name, without
any spaces between.


\section*{Input}

The first line contains two integers. The first integer $K$ ($1 \leq K
\leq 10^9$), denotes the depth of the target name in the family tree. The second
integer $C$ ($0 \leq C \leq 5\times 10^{12}$), denotes which character of the target
name to compute. It is guaranteed that $C$ will be less than the length of the
target name at depth $K$.

The second line contains three space-separated non-empty strings of uppercase
English letters, dollar signs (\$), or single quotes ('), denoting the first,
middle, and last names, respectively, of the name at the top of the family tree.
The length of each string will be at most $10^5$ characters.


\section*{Output}

Display a single character which is the $C$th index character of the
concatenation of the first, middle, and last name at depth $K$ in the family
tree.
