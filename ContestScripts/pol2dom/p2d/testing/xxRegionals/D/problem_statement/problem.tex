You are playing a new platforming game on a 2D grid. There are $N$ platforms numbered from $1$ to $N$ spread out in the world. Platform $i$ covers the range from $L_i$ to $R_i$. You can start at any platform you choose and then must jump between platforms. You can jump from platform $a$ to platform $b$ if their ranges overlap. That is, there is some integer $x$ such that $L_a \leq x \leq R_a$ and $L_b \leq x \leq R_b$.

Once you visit a platform (by either starting there or jumping to it), you can never jump onto that platform again. You win the game by visiting all of the platforms.

Find out if it is possible to win the game. If it is, show a way to visit all of the platforms.


\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains a single integer $N$~($1 \leq N \leq 500\,000$), which is the number of platforms.

The next $N$ lines describe the platforms. Each of these lines contains two integers $L_i$~($1 \leq L_i \leq 10^9$) and $R_i$~($L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9$). This represents that platform $i$ covers the range from $L_i$ to $R_i$.


\section*{Output}

If it's not possible to visit each platform exactly once, display \texttt{NO}. Otherwise, display \texttt{YES} followed by $N$ integers representing the order to visit each platform. If there are multiple solutions, any will be accepted.
